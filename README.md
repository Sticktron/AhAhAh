Ah!Ah!Ah! is a themeable unlock error alarm inspired by Jurassic Park.
Think of it like a car alarm for your iPhone/iPod/iPad, except that it triggers a video when someone tries to unlock your device.

Three themes are included: the new default "Jurassic" theme, the old "Classic" theme, and a Kevin Hart "Mind Your Damn Business" theme.

Personal themes can be created quickly by selecting videos from your Camera Roll.

Themers can easily create third-party themes and share them as Debian (.deb) packages.
See my [AhAhAh-Sample-Theme](http://github.com/sticktron/AhAhAh-Sample-Theme) project for an example of the custom theme format.
